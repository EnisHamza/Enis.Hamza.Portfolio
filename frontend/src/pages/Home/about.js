            Hello! Iâ€™m Enis, a dedicated software developer with a passion for
            creating innovative and efficient solutions. My journey in the tech
            world began with a fascination for how things work live in the
            internet.

            I graduated from University of Bussiness and Technology, where I
            developed a solid foundation in Software Development. I strive to
            write clean, maintainable code while always seeking to learn and
            adapt to new challenges. I value transparency and open
            communication, which I find essential for successful teamwork and
            project outcomes.
